Introduction {#intro}
=====================

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	Web developers, design tools and design system developers
	often use color functions to assist in scaling the design 
	of their component color relations.
	With the increasing usage of design systems that support multiple platforms 
	and multiple user preferences, like the increased capability of Dark Mode in UI,
	this becomes even more useful to not need to manually set color,
	and to instead have a single source from which schemes are calculated.

	Currently Sass, calc() on HSL values, or PostCSS is used to do this.
	Preprocessors are unable to work on dynamically adjusted colors, 
	all current solutions are restricted to the sRGB gamut 
	and to the perceptual limitations of HSL
	(colors are bunched up in the color wheel,
	and two colors with visually different lightness,
	like yellow and blue, can have the same HSL lightness).

	This module adds two functions:
	''color-mix'',
	''color-contrast''.

	The perceptually uniform ``lch()`` colorspace
	is used for mixing by default,
	as this has no gamut restrictions
	and colors are evenly distributed.
	However, other colorspaces can be specified,
	including ``hsl()`` or ``srgb`` if desired.

	Issue(3187): there are two proposals for color modification (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3187#issuecomment-499126198">proposal 1</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/una/edcfa0d3600e0b89b2ebf266bf549721">proposal 2</a>).
	The CSS WG expects that the best aspects of each
	will be chosen to produce a single eventual solution.

Mixing colors: the ''color-mix'' function {#colormix}
=====================================================

	This function takes two <<color>> specifications
	and returns the result of mixing them,
	in a given colorspace,
	by a specified amount.

	Unless otherwise specified,
	the mixing is done in the ''lch()'' colorspace.

	Multiple color functions can be specified.


<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>color-mix()</dfn> = color-mix( <<color>>  <<color>> [ <<number>> | <<percentage>> | [ <<color-function>> <<colorspace>>? ]?] )
</pre>

<div class="example">
	This example produces the mixture of red and white,
	in ''lch()'' colorspace (the default),
	with the lightness being 50% of the lightness of red
	(and thus, 50% of the lightness of white).
	The chroma and hue of red are left unchanged.

	<pre class="lang-css">mix-color(red, white, lightness(50%));</pre>

	The calculation is as follows:
	  * sRGB red (#F00) is lch(54.2917 106.8390 40.8526)
	  * sRGB white (#FFF) is lch(100 0 0)
	  * mix lightness is 54.2917 * 0.5 + 100 * 0.5 = 77.14585
	  * mixed result is lch(77.14585 81.95 37.192)
	  * which results in a lighter red, like a Salmon color

	<!-- showing out of gamut colors next -->

</div>

<div class="example">
	This example produces the mixture of red and yellow,
	in ''lch()'' colorspace (the default),
	with the lightness being 30% of the lightness of red
	(and thus, 70% of the lightness of yellow).
	The chroma and hue of red are left unchanged.

	<pre class="lang-css">mix-color(red, yellow, lightness(30%));</pre>

	The calculation is as follows:
	  * sRGB red (#F00) is lch(54.2917 106.8390 40.8526)
	  * sRGB yellow (#FF0) is lch(97.6071 94.7077 99.5746)
	  * mix lightness is 54.2917 * 0.3 + 97.6071 * 0.7 = 84.6125
	  * mixed result is lch(84.6125 106.8390 40.8526)
	  * which is a very light red (and outside the gamut of sRGB: rgb(140.4967% 51.2654% 32.6891%))

	<!-- Maybe the first example should reslve to an in-gamut color; show out of gamut colors later? -->
</div>

Instead of a list of color functions,
a plain number or percentage can be specified,
which applies to all color channels.

<div class="example">
	This example produces the mixture of red and yellow,
	in ''lch'' colorspace (the default),
	with each lch channel being 65% of the value for red
	and 35% of the value for yellow.

	Note: interpolating on hue and chroma
	keeps the intermediate colors
	as saturated as the endpoint colors.

	<pre class="lang-css">mix-color(red, yellow, 65%);</pre>

	The calculation is as follows:
		* sRGB red (#F00) is lch(54.2917 106.8390 40.8526)
		* sRGB yellow (#FF0) is lch(97.6071 94.7077 99.5746)
		* mix lightness is 54.2917 * 0.65 + 97.6071 * 0.35 = 69.4521
		* mix chroma is 106.83 * 0.65 + 94.7077 * 0.35 = 102.5872
		* mix hue is 40.8526 * 0.65 + 99.5746 * 0.35 = 61.4053
		* mixed result is lch(69.4521 102.5872 61.4053)
		* which is a red-orange: rgb(75.3600% 65.6304% 16.9796%)
</div>

Selecting the most contrasting color: the ''color-contrast()'' function {#colorcontrast}
========================================================================================

	This function takes, firstly, a single color
	(typically a background, but not necessarily),
	and then second, a list of colors;
	it selects from that list
	the color with highest luminance contrast
	to the single color.

	<div class="example">
		<pre class="lang-css">color-contrast(wheat tan, sienna, var(--myAccent), #d2691e)</pre>

		The calculation is as follows:
			* wheat (#f5deb3), the background, has relative luminance 0.749
			* tan (#d2b48c) has relative luminance 0.482 and contrast ratio 1.501
			* sienna (#a0522d) has relative luminance 0.137 and contrast ratio 4.273
			* suppose myAccent has the value #b22222
			* #b22222 has relative luminance 0.107 and contrast ratio 5.081
			* #d2691e has relative luminance 0.305 and contrast ratio 2.249
			* The highest contrast ratio is 5.081 so var(--myAccent) wins

	</div>
